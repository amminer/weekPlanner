<p>
This is the second program in a series written for PSU's programming systems course.
Each program in the series required that certain data structures be implemented and used,
as well as a certain amount of restriction on the design of the class hierarchy, but the overall design of the program was left up to students.
Please do check out how my code evolved as I became more familiar with inheritance-based hierarchy/OOP in C++ and Python:
