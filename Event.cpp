 * PURPOSE:		Something about the implementation details of classes
 *				defined in this file TODO
 *			from header:
 *				classes Flight, Dinner, and Yoga.
 *				Event objects are composed of one WeekdayTime to
 *				represent start time, one for stop time, two char*s
 *				for name and location, and derived data depending
 *				on the subclass.
 *				These classes + the linked list and node class templates
 *				are for operator overloading practice.
