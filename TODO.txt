Implement event (still working on derived classes, UI setup function)
	+ make setup_from_cin return to the exact correct point in the prompts when it catches a time_exception
	  (currently jumps back to weekday input even if it should already know the weekday chosen)

Finish headers (shouldn't be too bad, but want to wait until events are implemented)

Implement eventlist (one week long, maintains non-overlap of all contained events. Rename?)

Implement planner (keeps a collection of eventlists to represent upcoming weeks in chronological order)

Convert Node and DLL to use unique_ptr (can't blame me for importing these from last assignment)

Convert event to use unique_ptr (whoops! Force of habit)
