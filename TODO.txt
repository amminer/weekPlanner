Implement eventlist (one week long, maintains non-overlap of all contained events. Rename?)

Implement planner (keeps a collection of eventlists to represent upcoming weeks in chronological order)

Convert Node and DLL to use unique_ptr (can't blame me for importing these from last assignment)

RETROSPECTIVE

Using strings for all user input and converting them to ints when and where it becomes useful has high overhead, but strong results for UX (imo)
	Default args create a convention that tells programmers what the input will be converted to - good and bad, conventions are mental overhead
	Smart pointers are very hard to understand... I kinda like managing memory, it's fun, gdb and valgrind are cool
