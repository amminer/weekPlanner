Implement event (still working on derived classes, some tweaks to UI setup function would be beneficial)
	+ derived class setup & setter funcs (and exceptions...)
	+ make setup_from_cin return to the exact correct point in the prompts when it catches a time_exception
	  (currently jumps back to weekday input even if it should already know the weekday chosen)
	+ STILL need to prune constructors now that I know how the UI is going to work for sure...

Finish headers (shouldn't be too bad, but want to wait until events are implemented)

Implement eventlist (one week long, maintains non-overlap of all contained events. Rename?)

Implement planner (keeps a collection of eventlists to represent upcoming weeks in chronological order)

Convert Node and DLL to use unique_ptr (can't blame me for importing these from last assignment)

Convert event to use unique_ptr (whoops! Force of habit. Just one char*, shouldn't be that bad)


RETROSPECTIVE

Using strings for all user input and converting them to ints when and where it becomes useful has high overhead, but strong results for UX (imo)
	Default args create a convention that tells programmers what the input will be converted to - good and bad, conventions are mental overhead
