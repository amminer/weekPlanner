Implement eventlist (one week long, maintains non-overlap of all contained events. Rename?)

Implement planner (keeps a collection of eventlists to represent upcoming weeks in chronological order)

Convert Node and DLL to use unique_ptr (can't blame me for importing these from last assignment)

RETROSPECTIVE

+Using strings for all user input and converting them to ints when and where it becomes useful has high overhead, but strong results for UX (imo)
+ Default args create a convention that tells programmers what the input will be converted to - good and bad, conventions are mental overhead
+ Smart pointers are very hard to understand... I kinda like managing memory, it's fun, gdb and valgrind are cool
+This project may be the final nail in the coffin for my unhealthy obsession with making strictly typed languages behave as though they're more loosely typed - see git log at 5/8 around 2am.
+ The runtime efficiency is worth to have to write more complicated data structures and algorithms (if you're using such a language and runtime efficiency isn't paramount, you should be using something else like python...)
