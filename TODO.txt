Write an insert_sorted function for the DLL (uses node->data and comparative op overloads (class event))

Finish headers (shouldn't be too bad, but want to wait until events are implemented)

Implement eventlist (one week long, maintains non-overlap of all contained events. Rename?)

Implement planner (keeps a collection of eventlists to represent upcoming weeks in chronological order)

Convert Node and DLL to use unique_ptr (can't blame me for importing these from last assignment)

Convert event to use unique_ptr (whoops! Force of habit. Just one char*, shouldn't be that bad)


RETROSPECTIVE

Using strings for all user input and converting them to ints when and where it becomes useful has high overhead, but strong results for UX (imo)
	Default args create a convention that tells programmers what the input will be converted to - good and bad, conventions are mental overhead
